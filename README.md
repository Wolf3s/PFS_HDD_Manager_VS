In the GUI the user can install new games in his Device, edit already installed games, manage files in existing partitions (OPL is a good example), clone disk drives and manage his VMC`s (virtual Memory Cards), all in a intuitive way and without the worries or issues that the command-line system can give

The software idea has come after the creator(leyed) got very frustrated with the way things went when he tryed to install multiple games in his device and dump OPL images for his games and VMC files. No good option was found, with just a program tha needs a one-to-one file enterring through commandline or a old GUI that corrupt`s the entire hard drive.

Actually the program is Ã¬n pre-development, with its initial structure being made.
