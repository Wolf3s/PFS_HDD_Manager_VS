I am looking for people to help revive this project.

The way I designed it was awfull and i gave up.

My ideal plan is to restart this project using an multiplatform gui system, and use the ps2 toolchain directly.

the original project used a weir method of calling pfsshell and readding its output to organize the gui, and it is really unnefficient.

If you want to help in any way, add a issue stating your intentions!
